                <p> High School of Telecommunications offers a program to young aspiring software engineers a chance to learn the basics of computer programming and the steps to create websites and do multiple things online that will continue to be beneficial to learning and potentionally save the world with a click. With the minds of the youth mixed in with the code they have gained knowledge of what they can create, something beautiful for all as this school continues to encourage our students. </p> <br>
                <p>The SEP Program here at HSTAT has been widely talked about through NYC and has been critically acclaimed by many of the boards over in DOE. The SEP allows kids to broaden their reativity through the technology. </p>

                <h2>Scratch:</h2>
                <p>Scratch is a language based program that allows you to create very cool animations with the use of block based coding. Block based coding is heavily considered for beginners to start off with as thousands of people have submitted projects in scratch with just a drag and click. Students consider this to be their greatest subject and would reccomend it. </p> <br> 
                
                <p>Some tips to be used in this program would be always pay attention to tutorials. At first glance this may be a little confusing with all the words on each block but of course, its a easy simple click and drag once you get a good hand of the basics.</p> <br> 
                
                <p> Always be creative as there is many stuff to do with this program, you can be able to create a game with all the stuff you can create. You can create a slideshow and many other things upon this. Always keep an open mind, and if everything, keep a handy notebook in case of any things you do not know that you can quickly look up. </p><br>

                <h2>Robotics:</h2>
                <p>Robotics is a branch of computer science and different engineering fields that deals with the construction of robots, using computer systems for operation of these robots. Robotics has many applied uses in todays world, ranging from sanitation to work in the manufacturing industry.  </p>
                <p>Creativity and imagination is a big part of robotics, so putting your mind to something can really turn out something unique and different from others.</p>

                <h2>Python:</h2>
                <p>Python works as calculations to do simple match with some coding. This is a program that will continue to teach kids that it is easier to let the computer the do the math and you behind the keyboard getting it done. Python is well-reknown to be easy for beginners and will teach simple math that cant be taught any where else.</p><br>
                
                <p>Some tips used for Python would have to be to be fairly familiar with some heavy math material and uses of numbers, as Python continues to use variations of math problems and numbers well buried in the code. Python is a internet calculator that you are able to design, as well as being something that tells probability with asking questions and getting specific answers so always be creative. You can be able to create questions, as well as an interactive adventure fun for everyone. Go through tutorials and make sure you are able to understand what you are doing.</p><br>
                
                <p>You can find Python over here:</p><br>
