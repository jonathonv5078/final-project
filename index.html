                <p>Scratch is a language based program that allows you to create very cool animations with the use of block based coding. Block based coding is heavily considered for beginners to start off with as thousands of people have submitted projects in scratch with just a drag and click. Students consider this to be their greatest subject and would reccomend it. </p> <br>

                <p>Python works as calculations to do simple match with some coding. This is a program that will continue to teach kids that it is easier to let the computer the do the math and you behind the keyboard getting it done. Python is well-reknown to be easy for beginners and will teach simple math that cant be taught any where else.</p><br>
                
                <p>Some tips used for Python would have to be to be fairly familiar with some heavy math material and uses of numbers, as Python continues to use variations of math problems and numbers well buried in the code. Python is a internet calculator that you are able to design, as well as being something that tells probability with asking questions and getting specific answers so always be creative. You can be able to create questions, as well as an interactive adventure fun for everyone. Go through tutorials and make sure you are able to understand what you are doing.</p><br>
