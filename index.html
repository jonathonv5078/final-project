                <p>Scratch is a language based program that allows you to create very cool animations with the use of block based coding. Block based coding is heavily considered for beginners to start off with as thousands of people have submitted projects in scratch with just a drag and click. Students consider this to be their greatest subject and would reccomend it. </p> <br> 
                
                <p>Some tips to be used in this program would be always pay attention to tutorials. At first glance this may be a little confusing with all the words on each block but of course, its a easy simple click and drag once you get a good hand of the basics.</p> <br> 
                
                <p> Always be creative as there is many stuff to do with this program, you can be able to create a game with all the stuff you can create. You can create a slideshow and many other things upon this. Always keep an open mind, and if everything, keep a handy notebook in case of any things you do not know that you can quickly look up. </p><br>

Python is well-reknown to be easy for beginners and will teach simple math that cant be taught any where else.</p><br>
                
                <p>Some tips used for Python would have to be to be fairly familiar with some heavy math material and uses of numbers, as Python continues to use variations of math problems and numbers well buried in the code. Python is a internet calculator that you are able to design, as well as being something that tells probability with asking questions and getting specific answers so always be creative. You can be able to create questions, as well as an interactive adventure fun for everyone. Go through tutorials and make sure you are able to understand what you are doing.</p><br>

Processing allows students to expand on their creativity with the use of code by creating images using polygons and colors, as well as even interactive games. These are created with the use of functions that students will learn throughout the unit and have a thorough understanding of.</p><br>
                
                <p>Some tips for processing are to go through various tutorials on different informative websites such as <a href=https://processing.org/>Processing.org</a>. Make sure to go through all tutorials, as many students who previously have taken processing belive it to be the most challenging topic.</p><br>

                 <h2>Git & GitHub:</h2>
            
                <p>Git is a powerful version control system that allows for the user to take digital "snapshots" of previous version of code, allowing for the creation of repositories for version contro, all of this being run in a command line. While learning the ins and outs of Git, you'll learn your basic workflow, which allows for ease of tracking your "snapshots", leading into GitHub. GitHub is a cloud-based Git repository hosting site that allows for multiple users to visually track changes being made to code, as well as collaborate on group projects with other users. The workflow for GitHub is separated into two, one being for initalizing your own repository (initializing git for version control), or "forking"/"cloning" someone elses project. These created repositories live on your command line, as well as on GitHub, so when collaborating on a project, members can "push" the changes they've made to certain things, as well as "pull" the changes made by others.</p><br><p>Some tips for Git and GitHub would be to pay close attention to your teacher. It can be very easy to get lost while learning this, as it will seem very complicated at first. Learning your workflow will also become vital in the future when working on projects within the command line, so make sure to always remember what your workflow is.</p>

In Web Design, you can really show your creative side through your code, using different elements to create new and interesting things using HTML or CSS. Further on into the unit, you will begin to learn how to add responsiveness to your websites, using languages like Bootstrap.</p><br><p>In this unit, some important tips are to always be attentive in class, ask questions when needed, and always pay attention to your teacher. Again it's very easy to get lost in this topic if you've missed a day or not quite paying attention in class.</p><br><p>Really, this unit is only limited by your creativity, so be as creative as you can when it comes to projects, or just making your own personal website to stand out from the crowd.</p>

                <p>3D Modeling is used widely used today to create virtual three-dimensional models with uses in various entertainment industries, health care, and recreational uses. 3D Modeling is a powerful tool for creating accurate portrayals of various objects, people, and everyday things everyone sees. This relies on specialized computer software that allows users to create these models using geometric data to string together obects to create a final product. 3D Modeling finds applications in the gaming, movie, and medical industries, allowing for better visuals, and in more recent years, the ability to use a 3D printer to actually bring this models to the physical world which includ prosthetics for amputees.</p><br><p>Some tips for 3D Modeling would be to always listen to your teacher, always ask questions if you're feeling confused or stuck on something, and if that doesn't help, maybe ask a peer for help, or consult Google.</p>
